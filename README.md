## About

This was a mini-project that I created in about 5 hours as part of week 4 of the Flatiron School Software Engineering program. This is a remake of the Blockbuster checkout system, I made it using a Ruby framework called Sinatra. Feel free to check the app out!

## Basic Usage

At the main menu, you will see the Blockbuster logo. You can navigate to any of the screens from here.

Here you can create a new rental by selecting an existing customer and movie.

![New_Rental_Interface](https://github.com/stephenandersondev/Blockbuster-App/blob/master/img/new_rental.png?raw=true)

Here you can see a list of all rentals. You will see the customer, the movie, whether it's been returned, when it was checked-out, and a button to see the details of that specific rental.

![All_Rentals_Interface](https://github.com/stephenandersondev/Blockbuster-App/blob/master/img/all_rentals.png?raw=true)

Here you can see the details of a specific rental. It's also where you will return a rental.

Here you can add a new customer to the database.

![Create_Customer_Interface](https://github.com/stephenandersondev/Blockbuster-App/blob/master/img/create_customer.png?raw=true)

You can also see a list of all customers in the database.

![All_Customers_Interface](https://github.com/stephenandersondev/Blockbuster-App/blob/master/img/all_customers.png?raw=true)

This is the Customer Details screen where you can see their name, what they rented in the past, and also what their late fee balance is. The late fee balance is calculated based on the difference between the check-out time of their rentals and the time the rental was returned. Multiple rentals will increment this amount.
